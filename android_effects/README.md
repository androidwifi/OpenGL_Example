Introduction
============

Test bench for different OpenGL ES 2.0 rendering techniques and their applications.
These are gathered into one application a user can navigate using ActionBar
tabs.

Currently implemented:

* Rubber, a Bezier surface cube consisting of roughly 2400 vertices.
* Splines, renders 100 Bezier curves each consisting of 80 vertices.
* Fractal, GLSL based Mandelbrot fractal with touch support.
* Blob, an elastic form generated using three control points.
* Particles, a 10000 particle system which demonstrates emitting and simple solving.
* Textures, transformed textures using one GLSL shader only.
